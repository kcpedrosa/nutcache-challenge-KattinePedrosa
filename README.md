### Commentaries


I left the Gender area as a text because there are so many definitions that the
option is better left open to avoid problems with alegged lack of diversity.

You did not asked for some data (like Gender) to be displayed on the main list. However, I have displayed it to show
that the data is really being saved in the database.

#### Additional commentaries

None for now.
